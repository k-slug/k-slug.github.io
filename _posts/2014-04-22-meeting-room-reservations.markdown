After a lengthy hiatus, I am happy to report that we now have a meeting room reserved at the Union for our weekly Wednesday lunch meetings. You can find the full schedule with locations [here][cal], but here are the next few weeks for your quick reference:

* 4/23: Union 204
* 4/30: Union 204
* 5/7: Union 202
* 5/14: Union 204
* 5/21: Union Stateroom 1
* 5/28: Union 202

Speakers/presentatinos/demos will be announced at a later date as they come. All presenters welcome. We don't even need to have an agenda.

Every Wednesday at noon at the Union, in the specified room. We hope to see you there.
