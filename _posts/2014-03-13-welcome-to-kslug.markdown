Welcome to the brand new K-State Linux Users Group (K-Slug) website! We figured it was about time that we updated the website source and made it [publicly available][source] for people to modify and update.

K-Slug still meets every Wednesday for lunch in the Union Salsaritas. The [#k-slug][kslug] irc is still very active, so join us!
